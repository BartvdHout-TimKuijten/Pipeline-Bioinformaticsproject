The goal of this project is to create a pipeline to automate the detection of ABR genes as well as virulence factors, and output the data into a standardized report. This report should be easily understandable by medical staff with little to no knowledge of Bioinformatics.

In the table below all the directories of this github are listed, as well as their contents and purpose
Foldername | Purpose
-------------|--------------
Workflows folder | Stores workflows from galaxy
Conda envs | Stores the conda environment containing all the current versions of the tools
Updates | Stores txt files containing different updates on the project
Pipeline test | Contains files where different tools are combined
Final Pipeline | Contains the final pipeline

Below is a flowchart of the current design of the pipeline
